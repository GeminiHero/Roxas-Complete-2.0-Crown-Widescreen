ABOUT
------
This mod is a combination of 3 mods; "Full Playable Roxas" by Napstio, and "Sora Replacement", "Sora and Folks". 

The additional "Coat" version of this mod also combines the "Playable Organization Roxas Everywhere" mod from Napstio.

As a result, this mod fully replaces Sora in all gameplay, cutscenes, and minigames with Roxas, and replaces Roxas with Sora in Simulated Twilight Town, and as the story/Data boss fight. Courtesy of the Napstio mod, Roxas has unique designs for all his Drive Forms and World costumes, as well as a unique Station image (credit to Feranelia on DA for the Station image, and to Reseliee on DA for the Halloween Roxas design)

This compilation adds new voice mods for Roxas, Sora, and many others, as well as fixes many bugs with the original, making it the most content/feature rich Roxas mod to be compatible/built for the GoA Randomizer, featuring both OpenKH and kh2patch versions!

A previous readme has also been inlcuded in these files, for those looking for what the previous versions changed or fixed; this readme is dedicated just to fixes and changes in the 2.0 version.

If you have feedback or comments, feel free to contact me on Discord! (GeminiHero#2876)

INSTALLATION
-------------
Place the "Roxas Complete 2.0.kh2patch" of your choice below any translation mod, the GoA mod, and any other randomizer related mods. (On OpenKH, make sure Roxas Complete 2.0 is at the top!) I cannot guarantee this mod works with all other mods outside the GoA randomizer, but conflicting voice mods should be placed below this mod and not above it.*


*IF YOU ARE USING OPENKH, make sure Roxas Complete is at the top of your list, not the bottom. kh2patch files load from the bottom up, OpenKH loads from the top down!

Only different voice mods, or anything else you want to override the Roxas Complete patch, should be placed below it! (Or above it for OpenKH)*


Remember to place all of your .kh2patch files in the same folder as your KH2FM_Toolkit.exe, and a clean KH2 Final Mix ISO, titled "KH2FM.iso".

Select and drag the .kh2patches you want onto your KH2FM_Toolkit, and hit enter! 

If you have any questions on where to get the tools listed above, please see the Garden of Assemblage google doc at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GYjEnrM_TIk7qyO75clPLYD-_nP5wTR7K6SE-Wn-QCg/edit for more information on the basics of patching KH2FM, and where to get translations needed for this patch!

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A TRANSLATION APPLIED, please install the "No Script Change" versions of the mod instead. The script changes included in 2.0 work on all English patches, but not the raw untranslated game.

2.0 NEW ADDITIONS (BOTH)
-------------
- Kairi over Namine has been introduced! (Credit to Napstio for the rigging!)
- A Crown or changing Chain color has been introduced as tells for how many proofs Roxas has! (Depending on which version you use)
- Many many new voices have been added or swapped, including all party members, many bosses, and some guest characters.
- Roxas' voice has been re-leveled and altered slightly to fit better
- Full HD portraits for all forms and every world have been added!
- Compatibility with HDification patches through use of the Widescreen versions has been added!
- A few new models, such as Roxas over KH1 Sora in the flashback, have been added (Credit once more to Napstio!)
- The Stick now takes the place of the Detection Saber. Please use it responsibly. (Credit to Napstio)
- Lion Roxas now has facial expressions
- Most every model has been swapped out for smaller, more optimized versions. This should hopefully cause less issues across the board.

2.0 NEW ADDITIONS (COAT)
-------------
- Tron Coat Roxas now has a blue-ish glow to better fit the world
- Coat Textures have been improved across the board
- Coat now also has a proof tell in the form of a new chain, and change of zipper color.

2.0 FIX LOG (BOTH)
--------------
This compilation addresses the following issues with these mods:
- Scripts have been updated and fixed (OpenKH only, regular was fine and still is)
- All issues with disappearing keyblades or T-Posing Roxas have been fixed (I hope; please let me know if you can create any situations where this still occurs OUTISDE of the practice seed)
- HUD portraits have been leveled out, causing less random movement when getting hit or critically injured across all worlds



2.0 FIX LOG (COMPLETE)
-------------
This compilation addresses the following issues with these mods:

- An issue where Halloween Roxas' arms would disappear has been addressed


FIX LOG (COAT)
--------------
This compilation addresses the following issues with these mods:

- An issue where the Vexen fight would softlock upon summoning an Anti-Roxas has been fixed. (NEW) (1.15)
- An issue where the correct portraits would not appear for Limit Form in the costume worlds has been fixed
- Limit Form Roxas' mouth textures have been fixed
- An issue where using Limit Form in the Final Xemnas fight would cause Roxas to lose his Keyblade has been fixed (1.1)
- An issue where the Coat model would not appear during the Agrabah 2 final carpet chase segment has been fixed (1.1)
- An issue where the Coat model in Agrabah 2's carpet segment would have corrupted mouth textures has been fixed (1.1)

KNOWN ISSUES (BOTH)
---------------
- World specific script changes will unfortunately not work on English versions of OpenKH (This can be solved by running JP/Final Mix region on OpenKH, and using a different english patch, however this comes with its own set of concessions). All system script changes work no matter what, however.
- Atlantica Roxas' LQ model's face textures are off-center. This may be difficult to fix with the current tools available (but looks hilarious if terrifying)
- World forms (aside from Lion Roxas) do not have moving faces in Complete, due to memory constraints. Some of these will be fixed for the eventual PC release, but is a compromise that has to be made on PS2. 
- Org Coat Sora's LQ model face textures, similarly, do not move. This may be addressed in a later patch, but is only visible in a couple cutscenes and not gameplay.
- Some HQ models faces don't match 1 to 1, so some facial clipping will occur in cutscenes from time to time. This is not likely fixable.
- Applying a 2.0 kh2patch to KH2FM without also applying or having applied a translation patch will cause the system text to break, and lead to a great number of bugs. SOLUTION: Apply only the "No Script Change" version of the patch if you want to play the mod without a translation applied! (It is unlikely this will be addressed in the future, as it would require rewriting the Japanese script, which will have to be left to other modders if there is an interest)

KNOWN ISSUE(S) (COMPLETE)
---------------
- Roxas' High Quality model will sometimes not unload properly, causing certain parts of his mesh (namely his hair, eyes, and chain) to float in some cutscenes.


SPECIAL THANKS
---------------
A big thank you to Necro Malice for his modding tutorials that helped me get started, and for helping personally with an issue the voice mod had!

Thank you also goes to FallenDejavu, who helped with ideas and testing throughout the process.

Thanks and full credit for the mods (and some new additions!) included in this compilation go to Napstio and Soraiko, who have graciously allowed me to share this compilation with you! (Soraiko in particular for making the very most basic building blocks this mod is founded on)

A HUGE thank you to PandaPyre for his creation of the Pride Lands Lion Roxas portrait, as well as helping with feedback and testing for all versions of the mod past 1.1!

Huge 2.0 specific thanks go to:

SkuddStevens, who provided the massive undertaking of ALL of the HQ portraits for Complete, and also a lot of help, feedback, and help with assets for the upcoming PC version!
Tommadness, who helped troubleshoot OpenKH issues and is responsible for bringing VladVidya's HDification mod to OpenKH, which is the primary HDification the HQ portraits for this mod were created around.
Vladvidya for his wonderful HDification mod that gave me the framework to build much of 2.0 around
Koaltoal, whose tireless effort in bringing the mod and all its script changes over to OpenKH in the first place laid the foundation for this update to begin with
Rapid, for helping troubleshoot a terrible time I was having with model swaps and UV issues.
VulkHylan and OmicronGamma, who along with PandaPyre, have helped a great deal with stress testing this silliness along the way

And one more GIANT thank you to Napstio for his continued help with troubleshooting, offering support in the form of new additions to the mod, and genuine support the whole way through. Absolutely none of this would have been possible without his work, designs, and insights.

If you have contributed to some aspect of this mod and have NOT been credited here, PLEASE send me a message on Discord or throw me a comment on Youtube! I have done my best to credit everyone's contributions and hard work, but it's been a long and messy process and the idea that I've missed crediting someone here is very possible. If you contributed and you're not here, you deserve credit and should hit me up!
